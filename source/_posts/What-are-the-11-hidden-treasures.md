#  What are the 11 hidden treasures?

There are many hidden treasures on our planet that remain undiscovered by humans. Some of these treasures are natural, such as the giant sequoia trees and the Grand Canyon, while others are man-made, such as the El Dorado and Atlantis. Here are eleven hidden treasures that have yet to be found by humans.

1. The City of Gold

The legend of El Dorado began in 1531 when Spanish conquistador Gonzalo Jimenez de Quesada and his men were searching for gold in what is now Colombia. De Quesada and his men came across a man wearing golden armor who told them that the city of El Dorado was filled with gold. The conquistadors never found the city, but the legend of El Dorado continued to capture the imaginations of people around the world.

2. The lost city of Atlantis

The lost city of Atlantis is one of the most famous legends in history. According to Plato, Atlantis was a highly advanced society that was destroyed by a natural disaster 10,000 years ago. Despite numerous attempts by archaeologists to find Atlantis, it remains undiscovered.

3. The tomb of Genghis Khan

Genghis Khan was the founder and ruler of the Mongol Empire, which at its peak controlled nearly one-quarter of the world's population. After his death in 1227, Genghis Khan's body was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in Mongolia. To this day, nobody knows where Genghis Khan's tomb is located.

4. The Temple of Artemis

The Temple of Artemis was a temple dedicated to the goddess Artemis built in Ephesus, Turkey in 550 BC. The temple was destroyed by fire in 356 BC and has never been rebuilt. Many archaeologists believe that the temple was located near modern-day Selcuk, but its exact location remains unknown.

5. Paititi

Paititi is a legendary city said to be located in the eastern jungles of Peru or Bolivia that is filled with gold and treasure from the Inca Empire. Despite numerous searches by explorers over the past few centuries, Paititi has yet to be found.

#  Where are they located?

The human brain is located in the head, specifically in the cranial cavity. It is protected by the skull. The brain has three primary coverings: the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater.

# Size and weight

The adult human brain weighs about 1.4 kg (3 lb). It accounts for only 2% of the body weight but uses 20% of the body's energy.

# Function

The primary function of the brain is to control the body's activities and to house the nervous system. The nervous system comprises all the nerve cells (neurons) in the body and enables communication between different parts of the body.

#  Why can they only be found somewhere on Earth?

There are many theories about why dinosaurs can only be found on Earth, with the most popular one being that they were wiped out by a meteor. This theory is compelling because of the evidence of a giant crater near the Yucatan Peninsula that is believed to be the result of a comet or asteroid impact 66 million years ago. However, there are other possible explanations, including changes in the Earth’s climate and environment that made it difficult for dinosaurs to survive.

Dinosaurs first appeared around 230 million years ago and thrived for over 160 million years before they became extinct. During this time, they evolved into many different species, ranging in size from tiny feathered dinosaurs to towering giants weighing thousands of pounds. Scientists have been able to piece together much of their history based on fossils that have been found throughout the world.

One of the biggest mysteries about dinosaurs is why they died out. There are many theories, but the most commonly accepted explanation is that a comet or asteroid hit the Earth, causing a global extinction event that killed off all dinosaurs and other large mammals. This theory is supported by evidence such as the Chicxulub crater in Mexico, which is thought to be the result of an impact 66 million years ago.

However, there are other possible explanations for why dinosaurs went extinct. One possibility is that changes in the Earth’s climate and environment made it difficult for them to survive. For example, some scientists believe that a cooling trend towards the end of the Cretaceous period caused food sources to decline and made it difficult for dinosaurs to find adequate shelter from the cold weather.

#  How do people find them?

If you are considering adopting a pet, there are a variety of places to find them. You can adopt from animal shelters, humane societies, and rescue organizations. There are also online resources that list animals for adoption in your area.

When looking to adopt a pet, it is important to remember that not all animals in shelters or rescues are considered “rescues”. Many of these places get their animals from sources like animal control or owner surrenders. So before you go out and visit only animal shelters, be sure to do your research on the different types of resources available to you.

The great thing about adopting from a shelter or rescue is that you can often find many different types of animals available for adoption. This can include dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and even reptiles! And unlike buying a pet from a breeder or pet store, most animals available through shelters and rescues have been spayed or neutered and have received all their shots.

# What should I consider when adopting?

There are a few things you should consider when adopting a pet. First, think about the type of animal that would be the best fit for your lifestyle and personality. Do you prefer a lazy dog who just wants to cuddle on the couch all day? Or maybe an active dog who loves going for walks and playing fetch? The same goes for cats – do you want a playful kitten or a calm cat who will snuggle up with you at night?

Another thing to consider is whether you have any allergies. Many people think they are allergic to pets when they are actually allergic to the dander (dead skin cells) that pets can leave behind. If you’re not sure if you’re allergic to pets, try spending time around one before making your decision. And remember – just because you’re allergic to one type of pet doesn’t mean you will be allergic to all pets!

Finally, think about where the animal will be living. Pet-proofing your home is an important step in bringing any new pet into your family. Will the animal have his own room with food and water dishes, bed, and toys? Or will he be sharing space with you? No matter where the animal lives, make sure he has plenty of access to fresh water and outdoor time (weather permitting).
